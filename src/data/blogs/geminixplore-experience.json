  "content": "On a bright Saturday afternoon, the tech community at United University buzzed with excitement for **Geminixplore**, an event that promised a deep dive into the world of AI. Organized by **WikiClub Tech** in collaboration with **TensorFlow User Group Prayagraj** and supported by **Google for Developers**, the event was a resounding success, leaving attendees with a wealth of knowledge and inspiration.\n\n### Kicking Off with AI Study Jam\n\nThe event started with an **AI Study Jam**, where participants explored the foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence. We delved into the latest advancements in the field and discussed the implications of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini. The session was highly interactive, with attendees actively participating in the discussion and sharing their insights.\n\n### Hands-On with Gemini CLI\n\nThe highlight of the event was the hands-on session with the **Gemini CLI**. Ankit Kumar Verma, a prominent figure in the tech community, guided us through the process of interacting with AI models directly from the command line. We learned how to leverage the power of Gemini to perform a variety of tasks, from generating code to summarizing complex research papers. The session was a real eye-opener, showcasing the immense potential of CLI-based workflows in the age of AI.\n\n### Inauguration of Road to WIKI Cohort 2\n\nThe event also marked the inauguration of the **Road to WIKI Cohort 2**, a new initiative by WikiClub Tech to foster a culture of collaborative learning and open-source contribution. The cohort aims to provide a platform for students to work on real-world projects, develop their skills, and build a strong portfolio.\n\n### A Day of Learning and Collaboration\n\nGeminixplore was more than just a tech event; it was a celebration of learning, collaboration, and community. It provided a much-needed platform for students and developers to come together, share their knowledge, and learn from each other. The event was a testament to the vibrant tech culture at United University and the passion of its students.\n\nI would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ankit Kumar Verma for his invaluable guidance and mentorship. I would also like to thank the organizers for putting together such a wonderful event. I left Geminixplore with a renewed sense of excitement for the future of AI and a burning desire to contribute to the open-source community.\n\nRead more about the event on Medium: [My Experience at Geminixplore – CLI & AI Paper Reading](https://medium.com/@anuragyadavanupam/my-experience-at-geminixplore-cli-ai-paper-reading-35bea3be5bcc)"
